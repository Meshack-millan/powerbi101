I learned how to use slicers and tables to make my Power BI reports more interactive.
I changed a treemap to a clustered column chart and added total product cost to compare with total sales.
I found the SalesTerritoryKey in the FactSales table and linked it to the DimsSalesTerritory table, which helped me see where sales came from.
I added a slicer to filter data by country and tested it by selecting "Canada." Clicking on a column in the chart filtered the data even more.
I created a table with details like product, color, and price, and I saw how it updated based on my selections.
Finally, I cleaned up my report by adding a title, resizing text, and renaming the page tab.
